# Change!
Change! is a lightweight strategic game where you can play as a city's mayor. With a budget and several thousand citizens to take care of, you're tasked with improving the city every day towards a winning zero-carbon future. 


I should probably also note that:
- the game isn't actually finished,
- the game isn't actually balanced either,
- the game is rather sloppy, and
- the game probably doesn't work.


Thanks for checking it out anyways! Feel free to steal the idea if it's even worth stealing, I hope you can make a better version.
